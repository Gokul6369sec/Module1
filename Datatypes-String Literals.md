## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.

men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
~~~
## Output
![439813454-6d64a5fa-b1cd-43a4-b1a3-dfa255432343](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef5539a-5357-4c12-add4-c7849a1c10c0)
